## Goals

- [x] Attempt every advent of code problem for at least two hours per person or until completion.

- [] Complet leetcode 21 days of dynamic programming https://leetcode.com/study-plan/dynamic-programming/

- [] Start developement on website

- [] 100 days of continious github commits. No insignificant commits count. 

## Next Week
