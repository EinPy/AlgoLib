# AlgoLib

Project to build a library of generic algorithms to be used in competetive programming
It will also include compendiums from time-complexity tuesdays at LTH
Current inclusions:
- Binary Search


Plan for what will be included:
General:

Knapsack 
Bit manipulation
Graph algorithms
Dfs, Bfs
Dijkstras
Tree algorithms (binary tree)
Strong connectivity (korsarajus algorithm)
Mathematical topics
