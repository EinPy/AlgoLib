Trees are non-linear data structures that represent nodes connected by edges. 
Each tree consists of a root node as the Parent node, and the left node and right node as Child nodes.

## Binary Tree ##
A tree who has at most two childres is called a binary tree. 
A nodes left child must also have a value less than it's parent value
and a nodes right child must have a value greater than it's parents value.
