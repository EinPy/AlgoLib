# HASH TABLE #
This is truly a great data structure.
Hsing a value is the same as storing it a unique place in memory with a
key that points directly to that value. The trick here is that one needs a hashing
function that gives unique places in memory for unique keys. I will not go further
into detail here and instead suggest the use of a Pyton dictionary that fills the
function of a Hash Map.
